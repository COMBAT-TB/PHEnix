Public Health England SNP calling Pipeline (Phoenix)
====================================================


This documentation is designed to give an overview as well as detailed API reference for Public Health England's single nucleotide polymorphism calling pipeline. Currently the pipeline does not provide stand alone means of calling SNPs, instead it interfaces with other published tool e.g. BWA and samtools.
